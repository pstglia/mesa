RFC patches submited by Dave Airlie as an atempt to support r600_ARB_shader_image_load_store on Cayman / Evergreen hardware.

These patches were adapted to current master branch (Mesa 17.x)

I've added a piglit result directory with results running it on my hardware (A10 5800K APU - Radeon 7660D Trinity/ARUBA)
